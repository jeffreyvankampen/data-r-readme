## Stakeholders Reviews <a href="#8e5c" id="8e5c"></a>

Receive feedback from stakeholders that is clear, relevant, and helpful. They’re probably not experts in giving design feedback, so it’s your responsibility to ask questions that steer the feedback towards project goals and areas they are subject matter experts in.

* Does this solve your users’ needs?
* Does this effectively address \[project goal(s)]?
* Does this meet all functional requirements?
* Does this effectively reflect the brand?
* Why is \[design request] important?
